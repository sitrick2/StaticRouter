Routing class dev plan:

Requirements:
x Enable basic routing (gets and posts)
x Enable calling basic routes statically (gets and posts)
x set up router to expect string containing 'ControllerName@function'
- parse nested routes ('patients/2', 'patients/2/metrics')
x enable PATCH and DELETE
x store routes in a routes.php file
x handle not found routes and return 404
    x return 404 result only once
x refactor to ensure testability

Extra credit:
X pass request bodies to controller on POST and PATCH
X implement closures AND controller strings as param2
- enable middleware
- handle csrf tokens
- make into a composer package
- import into webapp
- dockerize application and store on github
